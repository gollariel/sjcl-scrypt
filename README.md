sjcl-scrypt
===========

An scrypt implementation in JavaScript, because that is not insane at all.

It depends on the [Standford JavaScript Cryptography Library](http://crypto.stanford.edu/sjcl/)
and shares its license (BSD).

To use, make sure you have `sjcl.js` available, then do this:

    <script src="sjcl.js"></script>
    <script src="sjcl-scrypt.js"></script>
